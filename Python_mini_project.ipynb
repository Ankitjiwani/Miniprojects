    "Create and encrypter in python based on the ceaser cipher. It is a substitution cipher where each character of the original text is shifted a certain number characters in the alphabet. Write a function that would require 2 arguments – the input text to be encrypted and a key. For eg: Given the input text ‘hello’ and the key 3, the resulting encryted text would be ‘khoor’. Here you can see that every character in the string hello is shifted by 3 characters. ‘h’ has shifted to ‘k’, ‘e’ has shifted to ‘h’ and so on. If a key of 5 were used, the resulting string would be ‘mjqqt’. This function should be capable of ignoring any characters which are not alphabets. Th2 character ‘z’ entered b\n",
